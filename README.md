# PCB for ADC-Based 128 GBaud/s SerDes Receiver
This repository contains the PCB design files for the ADC-based 128 Gbaud/s SerDes Rx project.
The project, named "PDMLSE", refers to a DSP-assisted non-linear equalizer implemented in the Intel16 chip (Q4 2024 Shuttle). 

For more details about the designs and layout, please refer to the **<ins>"TestPlan.pdf"</ins>**, **<ins>"fabrication drawing.pdf"</ins>**, or **<ins>"pdmlse_pcb.pdf"</ins>** files or contact Kunmo (kunmok@berkeley.edu).
